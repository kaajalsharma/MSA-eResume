# MSA-eResume

Welcome to eBoard, my one stop resume shop! You can access my eResume created as part of the Microsoft Student Accelerator Program at the following address:
http://myresumeblog.azurewebsites.net/

The issues I encountered with my website when originally created was lack of design and interaction-based user activity. Therefore, it was imperative for me to implement plugins. Plugins allowed me to incorporate and leverage important functions that were otherwise missing.

I used 6 key plugin types to build my online resume website and resolve the initial issues. These included:
-	Front-end page builder plugin (Elementor)
-	WordPress SEO organiser plugin (All in one SEO pack)
-	Google Analytics plugin (Monster Insights)
-	High performance page caching plugin (LiteSpeed Cache)
-	Security and malware scanner plugin (Sucuri Security)
-	Form builder plugin (WPForms Lite)

All of the above succeeded in providing my website with a layer of basic website function and security activity ideal to attain a uniform and professional theme. 

Thank you!
